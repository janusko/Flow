# FLOW
### Water Consumption Data Visualization
FLOW allows users to create an account, using BCrypt for authentication, to keep track of their own personal water footprint. Each entry will be stored in a MySQL database, which can be referenced and deleted on the user's dashboard. Each entry will then be displayed on a graph, made with Graph.js, to allow each user to visually track see how much water they have consumed over the course of their account life.

## Technologies used:
Java | JavaScript | MySQL | CSS | HTML | BCrypt | External APIs | Graph.js
